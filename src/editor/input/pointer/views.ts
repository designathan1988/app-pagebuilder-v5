// pointer state the canvas chrome, the rulers, the panels and the keymap read — the marquee's band, the hovered node,
// the drag in progress and the drop it proposes, the ghosts coming back, where the pointer is, whether Alt is held.
//
// None of it is editor state: it changes no command, it is not stored in the project and it is not undoable. Each is a
// value with a subscribe, so a React control redraws on it and nothing else. The installer is the only writer, through
// the setters here; a reader only gets and subscribes. Each editor has its own (the plan's T7): pointerViews(store)
// hands out the views of that editor's store, made the first time they are asked for, so two editors never share a
// drag, a hover or a band.
