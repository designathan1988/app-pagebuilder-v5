// never writes, loads, creates or selects anything, so a test can change the editor only through its doors. It is
// installed, frozen on window, in the dev server and in the e2e build (the suite tests the packaged app,
// playwright.config.ts; npm run ui drives the dev server or `npm run build:e2e`), never in the build a person uses
// (the audit's AUD-10: src/main.tsx, vite.config.ts).
