// The pages of the project (spec explorer-pages): how a project gains a page, keeps
// its name and its file straight, and loses one. The document holds them in their order (`document.pages`), the
// Explorer lists them, and every command that acts on "the page" reads the first one until pages.switch arrives.
//
// pages.add (the Explorer's Pages section header): a page named after the text its door hands (refused when another
// page holds it), or the next free default name ("Page", "Page 2"…; spec explorer-pages, Problems 3); its file is the
// name's slug ("About us" -> about-us.html), numbered when taken, and its root is the root element the manifest gives
// every page (validate.ts ModelRules.root). The new page opens (spec explorer-pages, "listing a page and opening it"):
// the editor shows what was just added, so the canvas, the Layers, the top bar's switcher and an insert all follow it.
// One undo step.
// pages.rename: the page's name, and its root's (spec explorer-pages, Problems 4); the file follows it while another
// page holds neither (so a file a link points at is never taken silently), and a name another page already holds is
// refused.
// pages.duplicate: a copy right after the page, every node with an id and a styles record of its own, "About 2" when
// "About" is taken; the copy opens and its name field takes the focus, as a page the + adds (jornada03 J20).
// pages.delete: the page goes; the home page (index.html, what the project opens on) cannot be deleted, and a project
// keeps at least one page.
