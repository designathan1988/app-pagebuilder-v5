// A selection made away from the canvas brings its element into view (spec keyboard-tree-walk Problem 2: "walking to
// an element outside the canvas viewport scrolls it into view (nearest edge)"; palette-click-insert: "the inserted
// element is scrolled into view if it lands off screen"). The audit of 2026-10-05 found every way of selecting away
// from the canvas leaving it where it was: the arrows' walk, a Layers row, the command bar's find and an insertion
// at the page's end selected an element below the stage, and the inspector named an element the person could not see.
// One rule for all of them: when the selection's first element changes and no part of it is in the stage's view, the
// canvas moves by the least that shows it, its edge an inset inside the view's (an element taller than the view shows
// its top). An element any part of which is in view never moves the canvas: a press on the page always reaches one.
// A selection made with a press in the Layers leaves the canvas as it is: the contract's drag-autoscroll scenario
// chooses an element far below in the Layers, then drags one at the page's top, which must stay where it was. The press
// is the one that made the change, read as the selection changes: read later, it was at times the next press (the
// Inspector's field typed in after a Layers row was chosen), and the canvas moved away under the person.
