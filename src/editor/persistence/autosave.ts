// Autosave (spec autosave-restore): the work kept between sessions. After every committed change of
// the document or the selection, one record holding the project's format version, the document and the selection
// is written as soon as the browser is idle (at most autosave.idleWait later, the plan's stage 4: the whole document
// was serialised inside every input, a selection's too): first to a journal in localStorage — written at once, before
// the page can unload, when the tab hides or closes —, then to IndexedDB, in one transaction; the journal is dropped
// once IndexedDB holds that revision. A journal localStorage refuses (its 5 MiB quota: a project with images inline)
// moves to IndexedDB, written at every change of the document, and the status bar says so once. A change of the
// selection alone never writes the document again to the journal (what a crash keeps is the work; the selection travels
// with the next record). At start the newest of the record and a journal is read (`readSavedWork`; a journal's is a
// crash's work, restored with a notice: spec autosave-crash-recovery), restored through the project reader every open
// uses (`restoredWork`, which src/editor/store.ts asks while it creates the store: the history starts empty), and kept
// as it was when the model refuses it (nothing overwrites it in that session). The status bar's save state comes from
// here: Not saved (no record yet, or a write IndexedDB refused, with its reason), Saving… (a change not in IndexedDB
// yet), Saved, or Recovery required (the saved work the project reader refused at start: it is kept untouched, and
// nothing is written until another project replaces the document, a restored version or File › Open or New blank page;
// spec autosave-corruption-recovery). A refused write is written again after autosave.retryDelay, and
// with the next change. While a change is not in IndexedDB, or a write was refused, leaving or reloading the tab asks
// the browser's leave-page confirmation (spec unsaved-work-guard).
