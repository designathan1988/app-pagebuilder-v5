// The editor's dialogs (spec workspace-settings-dialog): View › Guides & Grids opens
// the Guides & Grids dialog (the Snap settings dialog belongs to snap-toggle-settings). One dialog is open at a time,
// held by the editor state (ui.dialog); opening one changes nothing in the document and records nothing. Escape and
// the dialog's close button close it (ui.dismiss, src/editor/menus/overlays.ts).
// The batch rename's dialog opens only on a selection the batch can rename (spec batch-rename): with the page root or a
// locked element among the selected, the renamer's own refusal comes at once, so the context menu, which offers only
// what applies, does not offer it (it was offered on the page alone, and its dialog could only refuse).
