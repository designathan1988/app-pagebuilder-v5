// The screen guard's exceptions (tests/support/screen-guard.ts): a finding the product keeps on purpose, each with the
// elements it covers (a CSS selector, matched by the element or an ancestor; for a control covered, `by` names what may
// cover it) and the reason. Nothing else is ever left out: a finding without an entry here is a defect to fix where it
// comes from, never a test to loosen.
