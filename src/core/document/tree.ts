// children in, and release the references that pointed at what is leaving — and the one test that says whether a move
// would put a node inside itself.
//
// The invariants this module owns are the tree's own, so the commands that move, remove or replace elements cannot
// forget one: a node sits in exactly one place, a reference never points at nothing, a move never targets its own
// subtree. Policy — locks, the content model, names, the words a refusal says — belongs to the commands, which refuse
// before they build anything (a predictable invalid operation never becomes a patch; see the store's commit).
//
// Every function is pure: it reads the document and returns patches, never a new document (the store's one applier
// applies them), so a command can compose several and hand them out in one transaction.
