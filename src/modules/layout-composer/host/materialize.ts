// The compiled structure written into the document (spec "Fluxo normal fora do Layout Mode", "Integração com estilos",
// "Stable Compilation"): the composed container keeps its id and gets the root's declarations, every compiled node
// becomes an ordinary element — the one it already was when the page holds it (found by its marker), else a new `div`
// in the tag the region means — and each element of the page the layout places (a content region) keeps its id, its
// own styles and its children. The compiler's declarations go through the style owner's own reader
// (core/style/set.ts readValue, declarationsOf), so a composite is written as its longhands and a value the browser
// would not take is refused, never stored; what the compiler wrote last time is taken back first, and nothing the
// person declared is touched.
