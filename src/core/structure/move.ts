// element.moveTo: moves the selection's roots (the selected nodes without those an

// the parent's children without the moved nodes, so it is the position the first moved node ends at (spec
// drag-reorder-canvas, "Result in the document": the dragged node is removed from its parent and inserted at the
// proposal's parent and index). The moved nodes stay selected; the status bar says "Moved … to position" among its
// siblings and "Moved … into" another parent (spec drag-drop-inside). A moved node that is locked or inside a locked
// element, a locked parent or one inside a locked element (spec lock-element, src/core/nodes/flags.ts), a parent
// inside a moved node (the node itself included), a parent that holds no children, a parent the content model
// does not let hold a moved node and a Link Block (or an element inside one) for an interactive element, moved or
// inside a moved node (spec elements-structure, Problems in Pager 5), refuse the move, in that order, and nothing
// changes. A
// move that leaves every node where it was changes nothing and records no history (the store drops it).
//
// element.moveUp and element.moveDown (spec move-up-down): the selection's roots
// (the doors' adapter.selection "roots-same-parent") swap places with their previous (up) or next (down) sibling that
// is not selected, in one transaction; the relative order of the selected nodes is kept and they never leave their
// parent. One command for every door (spec, Problems 2). Roots that do not share one parent are refused, and so is a
// locked root or one inside a locked element (spec lock-element); so is a press that moves nothing: the first (last)
// place says "Already at the start (end) of <parent>" and adds no history entry. The status bar names the one moved
// node with its new position among its siblings, or counts several (spec, Problems 1). The selection stays as it is.
