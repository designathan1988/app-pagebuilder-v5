// element.applyHtml (the manifest's code-panel-edit-html): the markup the person
// edited in the code pane's HTML tab, read as nodes by the importer's rules (src/core/import/import.ts, the one owner
// of turning markup into nodes) and written on the document in place of the selected element's subtree. The element
// keeps its id and its name — the markup's root IS that element, so its tag, its attributes and its text come from the
// markup while its identity and its styles stay — and a node the markup leaves where it was (the same position among
// its parent's children, the same tag and type) keeps its id, its name and its styles: what the markup does not say,
// the document keeps; what the markup moves, adds or retags is a new element. One undo step; a locked element refuses
// (spec lock-element), and markup the model refuses is refused with the line of the piece that is wrong and why.
