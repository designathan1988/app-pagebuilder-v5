// Panel bodies: whether a panel has its content. A panel has it when the shell draws a body for it,
// and the answer is read from the tables the shell draws its bodies from, never from a status written by hand: a
// sidebar view has a body when SIDEBAR_VIEWS (sidebar.tsx) has one, a dock tab when DOCK_TABS (dock.tsx) has one, a
// section when the view it is in has one — or, for a section of no view, when SIDEBAR_SECTIONS has one; the panels of
// the shell's own frame (the inspector column, the canvas tools, the workbench) are drawn by the shell itself.
// shell.tsx hands the answer to every door through PanelBodies, so the doors never import the views, which draw doors.
