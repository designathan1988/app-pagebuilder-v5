// Pointer input: the one owner of pointer, mouse and drag input on the canvas. Lint rule
// builder/pointer-owner refuses pointer, mouse and drag listeners and props anywhere else; a control's onClick stays
// with the control. Presses reach the canvas on its overlay (the iframe takes no pointer event) and on the stage
// around the frame; the node under the pointer comes from the coordinates module.
//
// Each press is one gesture, run by an explicit state machine (idle → pressed → dragging → idle) whose threshold is
// the manifest's drag.threshold. The door of the press is found by its data (a canvas click's target, button, count
// and modifier), and the gesture's doors run through one transaction the pointer owner opens with store.gesture()
// when the press starts and commits when it ends, or cancels when the browser takes the pointer away: a whole
// gesture is one undo step, and no handler ever opens a transaction (lint rule builder/gesture-owner). A drag pressed
// on the empty area of the page or of a container with children is the marquee (spec marquee-select), whose band it
// publishes for the canvas chrome.
//
// A primary press on any other element (a leaf, an empty container) that turns into a drag drags the selection's
// roots (the press has just selected the element): each move asks the drop proposal (src/editor/drag/drop.ts) where
// they would land, publishes it for the canvas chrome (hysteresis: drag.hysteresis), and the release runs the
// canvas-drag door of the drawn proposal's zone (beside a sibling, or inside a container) with its parent and index,
// inside the same gesture.
//
// A double-click on a text element starts its edit in place; while a text is edited, a press elsewhere keeps the text
// once its own door has run (spec text-edit-inline), and a press on the text toolbar over the canvas is its control's
// click, which leaves the focus in the text (spec text-inline-formatting).
//
// A primary press on a palette tile (the tile door of the command whose canvas-drag door takes a palette tile as its
// source) is a gesture too (spec palette-drag-insert, "Trigger"): released below drag.threshold it is the tile's click
// and runs the tile's door at the release; past the threshold it is a creation drag with no dragged node, which asks
// the same drop proposal and publishes it for the same drop indicator, and whose release runs the palette-drag door
// with the tile's entry and the drawn proposal's parent and index, inside the gesture: one undo step. Released where
// there is no proposal (outside the page), it inserts nothing.
//
// The keys of a drag (spec drag-level-keys-escape) run through the gesture too (keymap.ts, drag key context). Each
// drag, an element's or a tile's, is the live drag of the drag session (src/editor/drag/drag-session.ts), which gets
// the proposal the pointer makes; the proposal drawn, and dropped at the release, is the one of the level the session
// holds, redrawn as soon as a level key changes it, without a pointer move. Escape (drag.cancel) ends the gesture at
// once, its button still down: what the drag proposed is dropped with it, and the release that follows does nothing;
// what the press itself did stays (the element it selected), except for a marquee, whose band is its own selection
// and goes back to the selection held before the press (spec marquee-select); a creation drag's ghost goes back to
// the tile it came from (ghostReturn, played by the canvas chrome).
//
// A primary press on a number field's label in the inspector (the panel drag whose source is a field label, spec
// inspector-number-fields) scrubs the field from the press on, with no threshold (numberField.scrubDeadZone 0): each
// move cancels the gesture back to the value held before the press and runs the scrub door again inside a new one,
// with the text the field held at the press, the pointer's horizontal travel since the press in screen pixels and the
// key held now (the gesture number-scrub: Shift, Alt), so the field and the canvas follow the pointer live and the
// release commits the last value: one undo step. Escape (drag.cancel) cancels it back to the value before the press.
