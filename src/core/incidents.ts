// The incident feed (the plan's T2): what the application must never hide.
//
//  - 'invariant': a command produced its patches and the whole-document validator still refused the result. That is a
//    bug — a rule the operation should have refused before producing anything — so the state is not published, the
//    incident is recorded here, and in development and tests the commit throws so the defect is loud. Predictable
//    invalid operations are refused by the operation itself, with a message; they never reach this feed.
//  - 'empty-change': a command answered with structural patches that left the document as it was (reportEmptyChange).
//  - 'error': an error the page threw (a render error, an unhandled rejection): recorded by the editor side, so the
//    person and the browser checks see it instead of a console nobody reads.
//
// A bounded ring (the newest LIMIT), process-wide on purpose: an incident is about the app, not about one document.
// It holds no document state and changes nothing; whoever draws it (the status bar's badge, the checks pane, the test
// port, the dev server's terminal) only reads.
