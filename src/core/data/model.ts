// The content of a project (spec content-data): typed collections of items, the marks that bind an element to a field
// of an item, the lists and the pages those marks fill, and the shared regions every page shows.
//
// Where each part lives decides what follows it for free:
//  - the collections are a field of the project (`collections`), named like components are: a unique name is what
//    every binding refers to, so a scenario, a person and a saved file all read the same reference;
//  - a binding is a mark on the element it fills (`bind`), so it travels with the element when it is copied,
//    duplicated, made a component or deleted, and never points at an element that is gone;
//  - a bound list is a mark on the element that holds the repeated items (`dataList`): its items are that element's
//    children that are instances of the list's component, in order, the n-th showing the n-th item of the query;
//  - a page made for an item names the item on its root (`dataItem`);
//  - a shared region is a component whose definition says it is shared (`shared`): its instances show the same content
//    on every page that holds one.
// No part names a node by its id, so nothing is left dangling when nodes come and go.
