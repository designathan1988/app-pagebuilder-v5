// Where the chrome may draw: the label rules and a resize handle's hit area (split out of canvas/chrome.tsx, which
// keeps the drawing). Pure: boxes in, boxes out — the caller supplies the page's content boxes, the visible canvas and
// the box being labelled, so the rules can be read (and tested) on their own.
//
// The selection's label has one place (the user's rule of 2026-10-05, DEC-70; selectionLabelBox): above its element,
// its bottom on the top edge of the selection's frame and its start on the frame's left edge — never inside, below,
// beside or moved aside for what lies there, at any size, zoom, scroll, rotation or breakpoint, for one element or
// several. Where it lies over page text it says so (`covers`), and the selection's label then takes no press, so a
// press meant for the text under it reaches the text (jornada03 J16: a label over a card's price selected the button
// instead). One thing it never lies over: the editor's own controls about the page — the breakpoint tabs attached to
// the page's top (D-1), where the one place of an element at the page's top falls (clearedLabel; the owner's choice of
// 2026-10-07): there it moves along the frame's top line just past the tabs, while it still stands whole over its
// element, else it stands under its element, the mirror of its one place, so the tabs stay seen and pressed (CLAUDE.md,
// rule G5).
//
// A drop label (placeLabel) never covers page content, nor a control the chrome draws (a
// resize handle or an edit band under it would lose the press to the label): it sits above its element when that space
// is free, otherwise inside the element's top-left corner when that corner is free, otherwise below the element; with a
// ghost chip at the pointer (a drag) it keeps clear of the chip too. Where no place is free it covers the least it can
// and says so.
