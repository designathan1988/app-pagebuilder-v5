// The check of the interface's text against the space it is drawn in (the investigation's C4, with the measured widths
// of option D; DEF-0573): for every door whose control draws a text of the interface, that text in pt-BR and in
// English has to fit the space that door's own label has, with 1 px of slack. The width of a text comes from the face
// itself (font.ts, no browser); the space comes from manifest/generated/ui-widths.json, where
// tools/ui-fit/measure.spec.ts records, in each screen condition, how wide a far longer text gets in the label before
// it is cut or breaks its line (the rule G5 asks: measure against the element's own space, never a track chosen by its
// place), with the text the label draws, its letter spacing and its transform. A text measured is tied to its message
// in the catalogues, so a message changed since is checked as it reads now, without a browser.
// The pseudo-expansion (140 % of the English, its ends marked) is reported, not failed (decisoes.md, DCS-024: the
// interface as it is gives 57 labels less room than that; widening its columns is a decision of the product).
// The measurement is kept beside the hash of the stylesheets it was taken with: a stylesheet changed since makes it
// stale, which is a finding; and every door whose label no measurement reaches is named, in a region whose reason is
// written below (none is skipped in silence).
