// style.applyCssRule (the manifest's code-panel-edit-css): the CSS the person edited in
// the code pane's rule for the selected element, written on it. The declarations are parsed by the one owner of a
// declarations text (style/custom.ts parseDeclarations: "property: value" pairs, a shorthand expanded by its codec, a
// url() put to the one rule of an address, the first wrong piece refused naming its line and why) and replace the
// declarations the element holds at the active breakpoint and style state (rules.base, what the editor edits —
// breakpoint-overrides, state-styles), as one undo step. A locked element refuses (spec lock-element).
