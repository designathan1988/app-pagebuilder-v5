// declarations text (style/custom.ts parseDeclarations), so this module parses only the frame of a stylesheet:
// comments, rule blocks, `@media` (nested one level, a rule inside another media carrying both conditions, which the
// caller cannot map and reports), and every other at-rule (`@supports`, `@font-face`, `@keyframes`, `@import`…) as a
