// with `changes.pick`), the press on the canvas (`#canvas-click-pick-target`) or on a Layers row
// (`#layers-row-pick-target`) runs the command with the node it landed on and clears it, and so does another
// selection (the editor state that follows a selection keeps no picker). Never a document change of its own.
