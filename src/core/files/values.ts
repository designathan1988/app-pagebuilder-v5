// What an attribute's stored value is written as (the user's real-use audit, items 7.3 and A3.4): the
// one module that turns a stored value into the text the page's output writer puts in the HTML (elementAttributes,
// src/core/render/output.ts). Two kinds of value are not what they seem in the document: a reference that names another
// element (a label's `for`, a link's `#anchor`) and a source that names a file of the project. A reference is written
// the same way wherever it goes — the target's id attribute as it stands — but the two readers want different things
// from a project file: the canvas draws it through its object URL, while the export writes the path it carries in the
// archive (spec explorer-assets), and the preview turns those paths into data URLs itself (src/core/export/export.ts,
// previewPage: its frame has an opaque origin, where a blob: URL of the editor's origin does not load). So there is one
// writer per reader here, and no third rule anywhere.
